# Algorithm 

This repo contains codes for some important and frequently asked problems in interviews.

The codes are classified according to the resource:
LeetCode, LintCode, interview and OA questions (labeled with company name), OODesign

Some miscellaneous problems are included under the LeetCode folder.

Contents in this repo are to be modified, updated and extended.


### LeetCode.util

The package LeetCode.util contains some classes that are provided by LeetCode and 
can be used directly when coding. The commonly used ones are implemented here for the convenience 
of local coding and debugging. 

Currently implemented classes include: ListNode, Pair, TreeNode.

The above classes also implemented some useful methods for debugging. 
See their comment docs for more details.
Other less commonly used classes are implemented within specific questions.
