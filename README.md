### LeetCode.util

The package LeetCode.util contains some classes that are provided by LeetCode and 
can be used directly when coding. The commonly used ones are implemented here for the convenience 
of local coding and debugging. 

Currently implemented classes include: ListNode, Pair, TreeNode.

The above classes also provide some useful methods for debugging. 
See their comment docs for more details.
Other less commonly used classes are implemented within specific questions.
